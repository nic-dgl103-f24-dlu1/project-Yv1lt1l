# PROJECT SUMMARY:

- I chose to design and build my own website.
- The most important purpose of this website is to bring people to the webpage and advertise my services.
- The target audience will be the general public, and to have them hopefully purchase a 3D model or contract me to make one.
- There is very few self published 3D rendering sites like mine. I hope to be able to build trust as a local Canadian artist.

### LOOK AND FEEL:

- I want to invoke a sense of friendliness and familiarity while also keeping the site professional.
- For inspiration, I didn't use a specific website, instead I took ideas from the design artworks on my computer.
- _Colours sourced from ChatGPT:_
- For colours I'll use a primary Soft Charcoal Grey.
- For accents I'll use Terracotta and a deep teal.
- Highlights and call to action buttons, I'll use a muted Amber.
- For backgrounds I'll use a Light Blue Grey.

### IMAGES:

- For images, I'll use ones sourced from my projects. Icons will be sourced from google fonts. I'll created a simple logo with my name.
- _Fonts recommended from ChatGPT:_
- Headings I'll use Raleway and body will be Nunito.
