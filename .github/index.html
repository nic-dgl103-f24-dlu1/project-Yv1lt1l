        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm an aspiring Canadian 3D artist! I first got into contact with
          the 3D Industry in High School and have since fallen in love with it.
          Most of my work has been with still images and inanimate objects,
          however, I am no stranger to animation work.

        <p>
          Locally operating in British Columbia, I have been creating renders
          for the past 4 years and have had my works featured in my high schools
          art competitions. I will consult with you in every major step and
          process of your creation, making sure your model is exactly how you
          envision. My worklfow makes use of powerful cutting-edge tools to
          ensure quality meets expectations.

          <h3>Donut Project</h3>
          <p>
            One of the first major projects I was involved with in high school.
            Took roughly 1 month to complete.

          <h3>Battleship Yamato Project</h3>
          <p>
            My first solo project was creating a model of battleship Yamato for
            my capstone project. It won my class's artwork of the week upon its
            completion.

          <h3>Battleship Nagato Project</h3>
          <p>
            My second solo project was the result of a challenge from a peer. It
            depicts battleship Nagato in its Second World War configuration. She
            sustained two direct nuclear blasts as part of post war nuclear
            testing, only to sink due to a torpedo hit several weeks before.
